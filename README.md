# Enhancing Blockchain Interoperability Through Sidechain Integration and Valid-Time-Key Data Access Control

This repository contains the implementation of a novel cross-chain architecture that tackles the challenge of interoperability and sharing capabilities between different blockchain networks. The proposed system utilizes a Sidechain that incorporates a valid-time key (VTK) data access control scheme, enabling secure and efficient verification of blockchain data across multiple networks.

## Overview

The lack of interoperability among diverse blockchains has been a pressing challenge in the realm of blockchain technology, significantly limiting its potential for innovation and advancement. This research introduces a groundbreaking cross-chain architecture that addresses the interoperability and data sharing issues, surpassing the limitations of previous interchain interaction systems. 

In the proposed system, interchain data transfer is revolutionized through the utilization of a Sidechain that acts as a communication bridge between two chains. The Sidechain incorporates a valid-time key (VTK) data access control scheme for empowering the verification of blockchain data across multiple blockchain networks.

## Features

- **Sidechain Integration**: The implementation includes a decentralized Oracle network functioning as a Sidechain, facilitating seamless data transfer between heterogeneous blockchain networks.
- **Valid-Time Key (VTK) Access Control**: The VTK mechanism establishes robust access control, ensuring that only authorized parties are granted access within specified time limits.
- **Cross-Chain Data Transfer**: The system enables efficient cross-chain data transfer, allowing the retrieval and verification of data across different blockchain networks.
- **Healthcare Data Exchange**: The proposed architecture is demonstrated through experiments in the healthcare domain, showcasing its effectiveness in enabling secure data exchange and verification of electronic medical records (EMRs).
